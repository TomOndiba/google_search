So I'm not very good at Git, and it's not like I'm collaborating with anyone.

So I actually only committed one time. Sorry about that, Git. I'm not using you the right way.

At any rate, there ya have it. My Google Search Results page. It's accurate as of August 11, 2016.

Sorry I didn't put in the actual <a> anchor tags. The hovers should all be correct but it was a piss-take to try and put in all the anchor tags and then reformat everything so it's not all blue and underlined.
